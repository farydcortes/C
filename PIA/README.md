# cryptographer

For this new project, it was thought to make a cryptographer, some will wonder what is that?
well a cryptographer roughly serves to encode words, links or anything "sensitive" 
that you do not want others to know.

## general functions
Once I have understood this, I will talk about what will make up my program.
for the encryption methods we will have the following:

- Morse code
- cesar encryption
- phonetic alphabet

In the same way, the cryptographer will work in the opposite way, 
so that we can decrypt a word by selecting the encryption method.
